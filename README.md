With the ever-increasing usability of plastic, we start exploiting it, which has a highly negative effect on our environment, marine life, and wildlife. In this study, we are exploring how plastic waste generated per person per day and the GDP per capita of a country is related to each other. We aim to find if the high-income countries consume more plastic waste by performing a Simple Linear Regression Analysis with GDP per capita as a dependent variable and Per Capita Plastic Waste as the predictor.
Following that, we will introduce another dependent variable, Population of a Country, and perform a Multiple Linear Regression and see if it improves the model for prediction of Per Capita Plastic Waste.
Our objective is to find a regression model that best fits the variables GDP and Population to predict Per Capita Plastic Waste.
Once we understand factors that are related to generation of plastic waste, we can work on finding ways to reduce plastic generation or finding better ways of waste disposal and reusability of plastic.
